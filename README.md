Created for Illumina Software Engineering Assignment

## Prerequisites

This application only works on Windows devices

## App Description

This application has both a Roman Numeral Converter, as well as a phonebook.
I wrote both because I felt like the Roman Numeral Converter did not have a substantial amount of code, so
I wrote the phonebook as well (Tasks 9 and 10)

## Stack

This application was created using Nextron (Electron + Next.js). There is no local database, so storage is not persistent

## Installation (from ZIP file)

Run the "Roman Numeral Converter Setup 1.0.0" exe file to start the app
